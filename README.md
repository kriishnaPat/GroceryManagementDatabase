## Grocery Database Management System
Created a C# program that uses JSON to read grocery items from a file, and features a login system so users can use to save there data. This program simulates the logic of an online grocery shopping app where users can add, remove, grocery items to there cart
and also sort them. At the end a users cart and login details are also saved using JSON.
